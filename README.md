# CerebroTree: Stroke Risk Analytics via Decision Trees

## Overview
CerebroTree is an in-depth exploration into stroke risk prediction utilizing decision tree algorithms. The project serves as a sandbox for probing feature significance and decoding the intricate relationships between variables in stroke risk.

## Files
- `CerebroTree_DecisionTree_Stroke_Analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook that dives into the implementation of decision tree algorithms and evaluates the importance of various features in stroke risk prediction.
- `CerebroTree_Stroke_Dataset.csv`: The dataset deployed for model development and scrutiny.
- `CerebroTree_DecisionTree_Visual.png`: A graphical elucidation of the decision tree algorithm employed in the study.

## Disclaimer
CerebroTree is fundamentally an academic exploration and should not be utilized for clinical diagnostics or in production systems.
